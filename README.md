FedWatch Upgraded
=================

These tools automate and expand the current manual process that staff at multiple federal-level LGBT rights and regulatory organizations are doing to aggregate comment opportunities posted in the Federal Register.

At this point, the toolset includes only (the beginnings of) a scraper intended to pull comment opportunities from the Federal register's contents page.

Deployed tools that have a front-end will live at http://www.fedwatch.org
